## About

Lord of the Quotes is a test of the user's knowledge of Lord of the Rings lore and character identification. Quotes from the book and movies are randomly generated and the user is tasked with identifying the correct speaker. A running, cumulative percentile score for correct/incorrect guesses per speaker is stored per user and persisted across sessions to create a long-lasting and competitive experience.

Unhappy with your score? Toss your history in the fires of Mount Doom restart your journey anew.
